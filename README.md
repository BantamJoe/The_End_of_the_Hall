# The_End_of_the_Hall
Unity developed horror game that incorporates simple machine learning

In order to execute the game, the The_End_of_The_Hall_Data folder and The_End_of_The_Hall.exe must be in the same location. Simply run the .exe to run the game.

The scripts for the game were written in C# and followed the "Clean Code" rules given by Robeert Martin in his book. Models were developed in blender and some were downloaded from the Unity asset store.

This game was developed as a Senior Project at the University of Scranton.
